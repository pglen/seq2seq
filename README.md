# Sequence to Sequence Network

# Next generation Neural Network.

 Traditional neural networks use a weight calculation to achieve their
functionality. This method is very processor intensive, and one needs to
be trained with exposing the data to the neural network thousands of times,
at great cost.

  Biological neural networks mostly need a single exposure to new
information. This questions the weight method, as the optimal solution to
this problem domain.

  Another questionable item is the process of training. It relies on
subtle changes to the weights by using back propagation, calculating the
reverse derivative of the transfer function. We do not believe that nature
uses such a complex internal working to achieve functionality of the neural
network.
